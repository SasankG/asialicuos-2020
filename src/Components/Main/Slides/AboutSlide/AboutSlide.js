                                    This year, due to the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan China, fears and rumours surrounding the virus have spread and many Asian restaurants businesses in Toronto have been suffering a 20% to 50% drop in sales, and possible increase. Through AsialiciousTO, we aim to boost sales at restaurants and stores that are suffering from the virus outbreak, revitalize the local economy and bringing the community together.
