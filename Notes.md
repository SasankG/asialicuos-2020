            About AsisliciousTO
            The Asian Canadian Community is one of the fastest growing communities in Canada with a significant presence in the City of Toronto.
            Inspired by Summerlicious and Winterlicious, AsialiciousTO is a month-long festival to celebrate Asian-themed food and drinks during Asian Heritage Month, explore Toronto’s food culture at participating venues with promotional pricing deals at $10, $20, $30.
            This year, due to the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan China, fears and rumours surrounding the virus have spread and many Asian restaurants businesses in Toronto have been suffering a 20% to 50% drop in sales, and possible increase.
